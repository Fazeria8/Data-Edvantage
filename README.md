# Data-Edvantage
Data Analysis of Majulah Junior College’s Internal Physics Exams

‘’The Data Edvantage’’ current outline focus is to assist physics educators of Majulah Junior College to be more effective and to educate them to set better exam questions.
To improve overall teaching methods and learning journey for students.
The both key points mention above will en-able the educators to plan and differentiate questionnaires to understand the students better.
The Data Ed-vantage is providing an excellent platform for all educators to define the expectations on each question; whether to discriminate or not.

Our Target Users

Who will hire us? Majulah junior college - Educators in physics department.

What are we hired to do? Educators require professional assistance to analyze their data and advise them accordingly on the recommended actions to take.

Who are our clients? We work closely with upper level heads, Management coordinators, Educators who set or vet exam questions.

The Data Edvantage Motivations and Goals:-
We will motivate educators to set better exam papers on how to improve their lecture and also to understand how their students perceive the questions.
We will help educators to reach their goals by comparing the insights from past exam data to improve, modify and remove any unwanted questions.

Educator’s cerebration - Brainstorming on the setting of exam questions, design from scratch or modify from past questions.
Labeling of test items - Educators would carefully consider the topic and learning outcomes.
Educators will label the following; (calculation, graphical, conceptual or mix); difficulty level: number 1-easy, 2-moderate or 3 to be difficult.
Final stage of Collating, educators will then collate all these data by using (TOS) table of specifications; a document that is used to review the exam paper entirely
Data is collected every year for each exam.
Post-mortem is done only on single exam – well evaluated and observed.
Lack of capacity to evaluate data over a long term.
Data will not be used to influence or to conclude when setting exam questions in future.

NEW INSIGHTS.
Challenges faced by Educators; How crucial is it to improve the effectiveness in question setting?
No Quality of method to predict the difficulty and reliability of the entire exam.
No means to measure or verify the ‘hunches’ educators have towards students’ weaknesses.
Unable to distinguish topics and questions types that tend to be less reliable for exam questions
Purpose of Exam; Exam systems helps create a fair reference point for a student’s academic performance:-
Assess learning and discriminate student’s ability.
Provide feedback to both educators and students, by doing so; students may tend to clear their doubts with their subject matters. Educators may recognized the level of knowledge the students has.
The guidance for subsequent lectures allow the students to follow the steps concurrently.
As for the Learning stra-te-gies; educators may ground specific learning materials to students so that they can maximize their learning efficiency therefore; plugging specific gaps in learning.

What are the Qualities of a good MCQ Exam Paper:-
Objectives:- Educators will discriminate students level of competency.
Exam that comprises questions that is not only generated and interprets in context but also to shape the context itself to be reliable and accurate.
Lets us look at the Characteristics which follows:-
Distinguish degree of competency.
Conceptually correct; the exam question set contains the correct physics topic content
Design of a question; Distractors (incorrect answers given in MCQ) well designed to capture common misconceptions.
Test Stats that consist 6 years of data that has over 23 test papers and 475 MCQ questions.
Average candidature per exam is 500.
More than 10,000 counts of students took their exam; more than 200,000 attempts on questions being made.
Both JC1 & 2 data is included.
What is the actual reason and shouldn’t JC1 & 2 be segregated?
We then concluded;
All datasets are for summative purposes and similar format of assessments.
Objectives and processes for all these tests are the same.
Student cohorts stay generally constant therefore is determined by A-Level subject attainment.
Last but not least we would like to highlight that our data is an internal data (in-process data) and from subject matter experts; and yet to be established publicly.
